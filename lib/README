*******************************
It may be better to rewrite the programs for homogeneous Neumann BC
such that the zeroth basis function \phi_0(x)=1 is included in the
mass and stiffness matrix so that a uniform approach can be used in
lenhmz2.f etc without treating the first row and column separately.

Indeed, we can set:

mass matrix:      B = diag (2, B_1) 
stiffness matrix: A = diag (0, I_1)
eigenmatrix     : E = diag (1, E_1)
eigenvalue      : \Lambda = diag (2, \Lambda_1)
where B_1, A_1, E_1, \Lambda_1 are those matrices excluding the zeroth
basis function !!!

Naming convention:

First two letters:

  LE: for Legendre
  CY: for Chebyshev

The number at the last position: dimension of the problem, ie. 1-D, 2-D, 3-D

ftos, stof, stop, ptos:

 tranforms: f, \phi;  s, Legendre or Chebyshev; p, value at the G-L points


dhmz: Helmholtz with Dirichlet B.C
nhmz: Helmholtz with Neumann B.C



REMARK:

If optimized BLAS is available, then

1) dgemm1.f should be replaced by dgemm.f;

2) call to ddot.f in the matrix diagonalization process should be
   activated.
